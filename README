*** PLACEHOLDER README ***

Please don't use Picel yet, I'm just uploading it here but I still don't have
it all sorted out :/ Some things may change, etc. Also I still need to upload
the documentation, OK?

BTW, Picel is a library for loading and saving bitmaps, though right now it
only supports PNG :O) (will add JPEG later, and GIF if I found out a suitable
libgif-like library or documentation)
